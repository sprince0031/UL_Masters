1. Application of Minimum Edit Distance in:
	a. Spell correction:
		1) Non-word: suggest the non-word and other words
		2) Homophones (paws|pause)
		If the distance is small, recommend the next word from autocomplete e.g. misspelled cost of substitutiong one letter in word "hello" vs "hwllo"
	b. Evaluating machine translation: having sentences in different languages and the edit distance signifies how good the translation was (to human translation). Threshold is set for calculating translation accuracy.
	c. Evaluating Named Entity Extraction: Arthur C Doyle vs Arthur Doyle (are close, same entity), comapanies, locations. Annotated already by humans.
	d. Evaluating Speech Recognition: transcribe audio (any model, not only nn). Test dataset as base.
	
2.	a. Hamming distance: only permits for substitution, compares same length strings. flaw and lawn => val 4
		Used for comparing gene series.
	b. Levenshtein distance: insertion, deletion, substitution => flaw lawn => del f ins n => val 2
		
3. Advantages of using Dynamic Programming over Recursion for computing the minimum distance:
	* Simpler? No
	* It's faster, avoids repeated computations as it stores results in table
	* Memoisation: store solutions to sub-problems
	* Iterative approach takes less memory
	
4. Confusion matrix for spelling errors (different to tp/fp etc):
	* Substitution of x (wrong) for y (correct) [alphabet on both axes]
