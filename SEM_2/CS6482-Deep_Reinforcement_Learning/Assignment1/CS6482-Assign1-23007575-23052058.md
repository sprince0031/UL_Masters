## 1. Introduction

## 2. Dataset
For the dataset, we zeroed in on the Caltech-101 dataset. This had the perfect mix of enough samples and classification categories while not being too much for our machines to handle. In other words, it felt like it hit the sweet spot between the mini-imagenet and imagenet datasets.

### 2.1 Visualisation
