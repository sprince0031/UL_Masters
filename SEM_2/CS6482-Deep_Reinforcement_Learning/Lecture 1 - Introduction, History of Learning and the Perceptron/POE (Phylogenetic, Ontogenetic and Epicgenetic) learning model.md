 [The POE model is a framework for classifying and designing bio-inspired hardware systems, based on three levels of biological organization: phylogeny, ontogeny, and epigenesis](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/bio-seminar/Sipper_POEmodel_97.pdf)[1](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/bio-seminar/Sipper_POEmodel_97.pdf)[2](https://towardsai.net/p/machine-learning/the-poe-model-of-bio-inspired-hardware-systems).

- **Phylogeny** refers to the evolutionary history of a species or a group of organisms, involving processes such as mutation, recombination, and natural selection. Phylogenetic systems use these mechanisms to generate diversity and adaptation in hardware.
- **Ontogeny** refers to the developmental process of a single organism, involving processes such as cell division, differentiation, and growth. Ontogenetic systems use these mechanisms to create complex and robust hardware structures from simple components.
- **Epigenesis** refers to the learning process of an individual organism, involving processes such as neural plasticity, reinforcement learning, and memory formation. Epigenetic systems use these mechanisms to acquire and modify hardware behaviors based on experience and feedback.

[The POE model was proposed by Moshe Sipper and his colleagues in 1997, as a way to unify and extend the research on bio-inspired hardware systems, such as evolutionary computation, evolvable hardware, embryonics, neural networks, and immune systems](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/bio-seminar/Sipper_POEmodel_97.pdf)[1](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/bio-seminar/Sipper_POEmodel_97.pdf). [The POE model also suggests possible directions for future research, such as combining two or more levels of organization to create novel systems with evolutionary, reproductive, regenerative, and learning capabilities](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/bio-seminar/Sipper_POEmodel_97.pdf)[1](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/bio-seminar/Sipper_POEmodel_97.pdf)[2](https://towardsai.net/p/machine-learning/the-poe-model-of-bio-inspired-hardware-systems).

### Question:
#### Does the formation of a hard cyst like outer layer in a bacterium trying to survive in the Arctic indicate it exhibiting intelligence?

If we were to go by the POE definition of intelligence, the bacterium in question does exhibit phylogenetic intelligence where it has demonstrated its ability to adapt by evolving a protective system with its cyst formation to survive in harsh conditions. This is a demonstration in terms of capability to adapt with "hardware".

Also, the bacterium has evolved to learn to create its cyst over generations. This behaviour is evidence of epigenesis. 

The bacterium does not have ontogenic capabilities however because by nature, a bacterium is single celled. There is no differentiation and growth here.

Thus, one may conclude that the bacterium in question exhibits a lower form of intelligence. Hence, our definition of "intelligence" should inform our decision to classify it as an intelligent organism or not.
