### AI Winters
When, why and what?

### PSSH
Examples
- ELISA
- MYCIN
### Factors contributing to explosion in AI
- Capable hardware - GPUs
- Good frameworks - Tensorflow, pytorch, etc.,
- 
### Markov problem  
The current problem has all the data and information required to solve it.

### Issues in computer vision systems:
Building systems that is invariant to 
- lighting
- scale
- orientation

### Types of Learning
- Supervised & unsupervised - calculating the similarities by calculating error distance
- Reinforcement learning - STAR - maximising reward
- Hybrid - combination of learning - example: unsupervised clustering for feature extraction and then supervised classification

### Computational Neuron
- Model architecture - slide 28
- Model architecture with bias term - slide 29

#### Activation functions:
- Signum/threshold functions - not continuous which is a problem
- Sigmoid function

If data is linearly separable, a perceptron system can learn a clear decision boundary.

### Exercise:
- Create data sets for 2 scenarios and a perceptron implementation to learn to classify the data
  - Linearly separable
  - Linearly non-separable
- Learn Perceptron training algorithm
- Try to replicate the double moon classification problem

### Reading:
- refer slide 43

## NOTE
- Frequently asked in **mid-term exam:** 
  - write the weight update code for perceptron
  - formula/algorithm for weight update
- Generally, a lot of code will be asked to be written in the exams
