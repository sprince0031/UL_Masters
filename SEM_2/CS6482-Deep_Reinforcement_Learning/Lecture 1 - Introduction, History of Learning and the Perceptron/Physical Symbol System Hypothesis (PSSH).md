Formulated by __Allen Newell__ and __Herbert A. Simon__, it is a position in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.

1. **Definition**:
    - A **physical symbol system** (also known as a **formal system**) involves:
        - **Physical patterns** (symbols).
        - Combining these symbols into **structures** (expressions).
        - **Manipulating** these structures using **processes** to create new expressions.
    - The PSSH asserts that such a system possesses the **necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action**.

2. **Implications**:    
    - **Human thinking** is essentially a form of **symbol manipulation** because intelligence requires a symbol system.
    - **Machines can be intelligent** because a symbol system is sufficient for intelligence.

3. **Historical Roots**:    
    - Philosophers like **Hobbes**, **Leibniz**, **Hume**, and **Kant** contributed to the idea that reasoning, perception, and experience could be understood through formal rules.
    - The PSSH aligns with the **computational theory of mind**, associated with philosophers **Hilary Putnam** and **Jerry Fodor**.

4. **Examples of Physical Symbol Systems**:    
    - **Formal logic**: Symbols like “and,” “or,” and “not,” with rules of logical deduction.
    - **Algebra**: Symbols like “+,” “×,” variables, and equations.
    - **Chess**: Pieces as symbols, legal moves as processes, and board positions as expressions.
    - **Computers running programs**: Data structures, programs, and transformations.

5. **Evidence for the Hypothesis**:    
    - [**Psychological experiments** on humans and the development of **artificial intelligence programs** support the idea that symbol manipulation underlies both human and machine intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_system)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_system)[2](https://bing.com/search?q=Physical+Symbol+System+Hypotheis+%28PSSH%29).

6. **Short comings of PSSH:**
	- **Lack of empirical evidence**: 
		[The PSSH is not a falsifiable or testable hypothesis, as it does not specify how to measure intelligence or what constitutes a symbol system](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/pssh-commands-parallel-ssh-linux-examples/)[1](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/pssh-commands-parallel-ssh-linux-examples/).
	- **Limitations of symbol manipulation**: 
		[The PSSH assumes that all aspects of intelligence can be reduced to symbol manipulation, but this may neglect other factors such as perception, emotion, embodiment, and social interaction](https://www.cyberciti.biz/cloud-computing/how-to-use-pssh-parallel-ssh-program-on-linux-unix/)[2](https://www.cyberciti.biz/cloud-computing/how-to-use-pssh-parallel-ssh-program-on-linux-unix/)[3](https://www.tecmint.com/execute-commands-on-multiple-linux-servers-using-pssh/).
	- **Connectionist challenge**: The PSSH is based on the classical or symbolic paradigm of AI, which contrasts with the connectionist or neural network paradigm. [Connectionists argue that intelligence emerges from the parallel and distributed processing of sub-symbolic units, rather than the sequential and hierarchical processing of discrete symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_system)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_symbol_system) .
