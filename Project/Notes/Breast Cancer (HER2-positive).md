## What is the HER2-positive gene expression?
The Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer indicates the presence of a particular protein receptor (HER2 transmembrane receptor protein) being over-expressed.
- This leads to a strain of breast cancer that has 
	- a high degree of malignancy,
	- strong aggressiveness (i.e, it spreads faster),
	- early recurrence tendencies.
- HER2 receptor protein over-experession is generally tested using a technique called Immunohistochemistry (IHC).
	- There are 4 scores which are 0, +1, +2 and +3; each of which indicate a different level of expression.
	- This is very subjective in terms of determining whether to score it positive/negative or somewhere in between. 
	- If it is +2 rated, the general recommendation is to go for further testing with DDISH or FISH based on which the HER2-positive scoring is finally decided.

## Different Immunohistochemistry scores for HER2 status
