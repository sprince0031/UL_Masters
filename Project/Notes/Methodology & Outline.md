## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
    - Gather a dataset of breast cancer pathology slides with HER2 staining.
    - Extract image patches from whole-slide images (WSIs) to create a training dataset.
    - Normalize and preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, color normalization).
2. **Feature Extraction and Representation:**
    - Utilize deep learning architectures (e.g., VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50) pretrained on large image datasets.
    - Fine-tune these models on the HER2-specific dataset to learn relevant features.
    - Extract feature representations from intermediate layers of the network.
3. **HER2 Scoring Model Development:**
    - Train a classification model using the extracted features.
    - Use immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining intensity as the ground truth label.
    - Explore transfer learning techniques to improve model performance.
4. **In Situ Hybridization (ISH) Validation:**
    - Apply ISH (fluorescent or chromogenic) to detect HER2 gene amplification.
    - Combine IHC and ISH results for accurate HER2 status determination.
5. **Quality Control and Assurance:**
    - Implement strict quality control measures for assay reliability.
    - Regularly assess model performance using proficiency tests.
